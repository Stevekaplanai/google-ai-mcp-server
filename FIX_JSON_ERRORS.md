# ðŸŽ‰ Fixed: JSON Parsing Errors in Google AI MCP

## Problem Solved
The JSON parsing errors you were getting were caused by debug logs being written to stdout instead of stderr. The MCP protocol expects only JSON-RPC messages on stdout, but the debug logs were contaminating the output stream.

## Solution Applied
- Fixed the `log()` method in `base.service.ts` to use `console.error()` instead of `console.log()`
- Published version 1.0.2 to NPM with the fix
- All debug output now goes to stderr, keeping stdout clean for MCP protocol

## Update Instructions

### 1. Update Your NPM Package
```bash
# If installed globally
npm update -g @stevekaplanai/google-ai-mcp

# Or use the latest version directly
npx @stevekaplanai/google-ai-mcp@latest
```

### 2. Update Claude Desktop Configuration
Make sure your Claude Desktop config uses the latest version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@stevekaplanai/google-ai-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "USE_MOCK": "false",
        "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT": "your-project-id",
        "GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION": "us-central1",
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON": "your-service-account-json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop
After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to pick up the changes.

## Testing the Fix
Try generating images again with the fixed version:

```
Generate images of ducks doing ninjutsu with knives
```

The errors should now be gone!

## Version Changes
- **1.0.1** â†’ Had debug logs going to stdout (causing JSON parse errors)
- **1.0.2** â†’ Fixed: Debug logs now go to stderr

## NPM Package
- Latest version: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stevekaplanai/google-ai-mcp
- Install: `npm install -g @stevekaplanai/google-ai-mcp@latest`

## Need Help?
If you're still getting errors after updating:
1. Make sure Claude Desktop is fully closed and restarted
2. Check that the NPM package updated: `npm list -g @stevekaplanai/google-ai-mcp`
3. Verify your configuration doesn't have `"debug": true` in the env vars
