# Lyria 2 Integration Status Report

## üîç Search Results

After comprehensive testing, Lyria 2 is **NOT** available through:
- ‚ùå Vertex AI endpoints (no `musicgeneration@XXX` or similar models found)
- ‚ùå Google AI Studio API
- ‚ùå Standard Google Cloud APIs
- ‚ùå Any of the regions tested (us-central1, us-east1, us-west1, europe-west1/4, asia-northeast1)

## üì± Where Lyria 2 Currently Exists

Lyria 2 is only available in these Google products:
1. **MusicFX** - Part of AI Test Kitchen (https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/music-fx)
2. **YouTube Dream Track** - For select YouTube creators
3. **Google Labs** - Experimental features

## üéµ Why Lyria 2 API Isn't Available

Based on our findings and Google's public information:
- Lyria is a research project from Google DeepMind
- No public API has been announced
- Access is limited to consumer products and select partners
- Music generation has more complex licensing/copyright considerations than image/video

## üöÄ Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Keep Mock Mode (Recommended)
Your current mock implementation is well-designed and ready for when/if Google releases a Lyria API:

```typescript
// Your implementation is already prepared:
- ‚úÖ Service structure complete
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types defined
- ‚úÖ MCP integration ready
- ‚úÖ Mock responses working
```

### Option 2: Alternative Music Generation APIs

If you need real music generation now, consider these alternatives:

#### 1. **Replicate (MusicGen by Meta)**
```javascript
// Example implementation
const replicate = new Replicate({ auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN });
const output = await replicate.run(
  "meta/musicgen:7a76a8258b23fae65c5a22debb8841d1d73400",
  { input: { prompt: "upbeat electronic music" } }
);
```

#### 2. **Hugging Face (Multiple Models)**
- MusicGen (Meta)
- AudioLDM2
- Riffusion

#### 3. **Stability AI (Stable Audio)**
```javascript
// Stable Audio API when available
const response = await fetch('https://api.stability.ai/v1/audio/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${STABILITY_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text_prompts: [{ text: "upbeat electronic music" }],
    duration: 30
  })
});
```

## üîÆ Future Outlook

### Signs Lyria API Might Be Coming:
1. Google has been expanding AI APIs (Gemini, Imagen, VEO)
2. Competitive pressure from Meta (MusicGen) and others
3. Growing demand for music generation in creative tools

### What to Watch For:
- Google I/O announcements
- Google Cloud Next conferences
- Updates to AI Test Kitchen
- New models appearing in Vertex AI

## üìù Implementation Strategy

### 1. Update Your Documentation
Add to your README:
```markdown
### Lyria 2 Music Generation
- **Status:** Mock mode only (API not yet available)
- **Why:** Lyria 2 is currently only available in Google's consumer products
- **Alternative:** Consider MusicGen via Replicate for production use
```

### 2. Add Alternative Music Provider
Create a new service for alternative music generation:

```typescript
// src/services/music-alternative.service.ts
export class MusicAlternativeService {
  async generateMusic(request: MusicRequest) {
    // Use Replicate, Hugging Face, or Stable Audio
  }
}
```

### 3. Monitor for Lyria API Release
Set up alerts for:
- Google AI blog posts mentioning Lyria
- Vertex AI model updates
- Google Cloud release notes

## üìû Action Items

1. **Contact Your Google Representative**
   - Ask specifically about Lyria 2 API access
   - Mention you have VEO 3 allowlist access
   - Request to be notified when Lyria API becomes available

2. **Check Your Allowlist Email**
   - Look for any mention of audio/music generation
   - Sometimes multiple models are bundled in allowlist access

3. **Try MusicFX**
   - Visit https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/music-fx
   - This shows what Lyria 2 can do
   - Helps understand the API when it's released

## üéØ Conclusion

Lyria 2 API is not currently available through any Google Cloud service. Your mock implementation is excellent and ready for when Google releases the API. In the meantime, consider using alternative music generation services if you need production music generation.

Your implementation is future-proof and will work immediately when Google releases the Lyria API!
