# ðŸ”§ Fix Applied!

The error "API key is required unless in mock mode" has been fixed. The issue was that Vertex AI uses service account authentication, not API keys.

## What was fixed:
1. âœ… Updated `base.service.ts` to accept service account authentication
2. âœ… Updated test scripts to properly initialize the service
3. âœ… Created scripts to help you test

## Next Steps:

### Option 1: Quick Test with Rebuild
```bash
rebuild-and-test.bat
```
This will:
- Clean and rebuild the project
- Automatically run the image generation test

### Option 2: Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Rebuild the project
rebuild.bat

# 2. Test with mock images first (no API needed)
node test-mock-images.js

# 3. Test with real API
node test-imagen-save.js
```

### Option 3: Start the MCP Server
```bash
# Rebuild first
rebuild.bat

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Test Scripts Available:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `test-mock-images.js` | Test without API (uses mock data) |
| `test-imagen-save.js` | Generate real images and save to files |
| `test-imagen-real.js` | Test various image generation features |
| `rebuild-and-test.bat` | One-click rebuild and test |

## Expected Output:

When successful, you'll see:
```
ðŸŽ¨ Generating and saving images...
Generating landscape image...
âœ… Saved: generated-images\landscape-16x9.png
```

The images will be saved in the `generated-images` folder.

## Still Getting Errors?

If you still see errors after rebuilding:
1. Check your `.env` file has `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
2. Verify `USE_MOCK=false` in `.env`
3. Run `test-api.bat` to check API access
4. Make sure you have the "Vertex AI User" IAM role

Your server is now properly configured for service account authentication! ðŸš€
